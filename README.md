# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions

Welcome! Here I collect my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) — with descriptions, 
difficulty levels, and approaches to solving them.

## 📌 Structure

Each problem is represented as a separate file and includes:

- 📄 **Problem description**
- ⚙️ **Difficulty** — `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`
- 🧮 **Solution** - `Python`, `SQL`
- 📈 **Asymptotic complexity** — `Time complexity`, `Space complexity`
- 💡 **Additional details** — brief explanation, approach, optimization (multiple solutions from simple to advanced)

In addition, there is a 📁 `code_templates` folder with reusable patterns for solving common types of problems, such as:

- 🔍 `binary_search`
- 🧩 `backtracking`
- 🌳 `binary_tree`
- 🌐 `graph`
- ...and more
